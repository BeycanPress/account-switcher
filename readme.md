## Account Switcher for WordPress (Multiple accounts plugin)

### What is Account Switcher?

With Account Switcher, you can add a new and super feature to your sites, especially by eliminating a big deficiency of your social WordPress sites. Account Switcher offers you the convenience of logging in with more than one account and switching between accounts on a device you see on many popular social media sites. 

### How to use?

It is very simple to use as you can see in the picture below. You just need to add a menu to the field you want to add with the ”#account-switcher” link. Account Switcher only works after login. In other words, if no login is logged, Account Switcher will be inactive.
